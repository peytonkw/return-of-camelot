His agenda was put on hold following a blue wave in 2034, and has since governed largely through executive orders.<br><br>Now America prepares for yet another contentious election season, the one thing in the way of Vance fulfilling the vision of his mentor is Senator Jack Schlossberg, grandson of John F.
